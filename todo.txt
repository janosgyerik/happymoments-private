version 0.1
-----------
get backup to work
confirm restore works
release on marketplace


version 0.2
-----------
prettier
    fix the button style when adding
        might not be worth it: in the target UI there should not be a pop-up at all
        as a temporary workaround maybe use the regular android buttons as other projects
    overlay a semi-transparent white plus icon button on the main image
    overlay stylish text with count
        maybe use easel to figure out the style


version 0.3
-----------
- move FileSelectorActivity to separate common library


version 1.0
-----------
make it pretty
